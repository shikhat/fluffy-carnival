Problem Statement:
There is a cube objects. And associated to these cube objects there are two properties which are height and weight. Write a program to arranged and display height in ascending order and weight in descending order.   

Solution:

Created two Java files:
1.Cubeclass.java : This class represents the cube with it's properties height and width. 
2. Main.java     : This class has the main function which is the intial part of the code execution. In the main taking user input for height and width. Then passing that in the parameterized constructir of Cubeclas. This class provides the funtion for sorting and printing out the sorted data.
In the commented code at Main method in Main class is about directly passing the height and width (no user input)
i.e directly initializing the cubeclass objects using parameterized constructor of it.
Used arraylist which provides dynamic storage, since in real life we can should limit/control such type of object creation

Steps to execute:

run the Main.java
then the program will ask:
Enter height
[provide height in int]
Enter width
[provide width in int]
Continue?[Y/N]
[Enter Y or N]

The moment user enetr N
it will show the output. Height in ascending  order and width in descending order.
